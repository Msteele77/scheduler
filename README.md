# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

- The planner will display the current date at the top of the calendar.
- Time blocks are provided for each hour of the work day which are color-coded to indicate whether the task is past-due, present, or upcoming.

- All saved events are saved in local storage and will still be available upon a page refresh.
